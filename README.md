## **Concept**
##### Design and create a simple to use pet adoption application that will streamline the process of adopting a pet from a rescue shelter.

## **Design Adoption Survey Application** 
##### UI provides the potential "new" family that will answer a brief survey. Based on results, survey will then render the results showing the best match based on user response. Note: this part still under ***construction***. 

## **Design Email Application** 
##### Application was built out in modules. The email module allows new users to enter their name and email. Using new technologies Nodemailer + Sendgrid, user is automatically sent a welcome email based on input. User is now part of Pawsibility Family. Register using below link. Upon clicking "join" check your email for a welcome response. Note: check spam folder.
